Day 65 of reminding @Blu I love her. ❤️

**And that's the final day of the series. Today marks the end of our 2-month relationship.** Recently, she's been going through a lot, and the distance is beginning to put a massive pressure on her; she wants something in-person, and she hasn't been doing well due to such distance. We are staying as friends for now, but it will feel weird, and that's something I have to get over. I know my mental health will be affected for a little bit, but I will grow stronger. The next chapter of my life shall be bigger and better. Thank you for tuning into the series.

Additionally, AT Products LLC will be temporarily unavailable. A new update is coming soon to the website and Mine Falls (a Minecraft world). Thank you for your patience and understanding during this challenging time.
