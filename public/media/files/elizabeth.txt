Christian,

In 1 day, it would’ve been a month since I had been sobbing in bed not knowing what to do with myself anymore. Wondering if love was ever going to give me a chance.

In 2 days it would’ve been a month since I had been forcing myself to be happier for the people around me so they wouldn’t worry. Questioning if I was ever going to give love a chance again.

In 3 days it would’ve been a month since I got an accidental friend request from the sweetest, most genuine, most precious person I’ve ever met.

And today, I wanna celebrate him. 16 years of such an amazing person who quite literally saved me. I went on a Roblox game for comfort as I once did in the past, and this time I didn’t just leave with a few reasons to stay, I left with somebody who’d give me a million reasons to stay. 

I really didn’t think I was capable of even being loved at this point. I was convinced that I was the problem and didn’t understand how God expected me to stay strong when I was only being happy for the family and friends around me, not myself. I understood that I was a teenager and had a whole life ahead of me, but I’ve always wanted to be loved still. Every time I had gotten it, however, it just left me shattered.

Until you, at least.

And yes, I know that our one month isn’t even here yet.
And I know sometimes we get busy and can’t talk much. 
And I know we’re far in distance.
But I also know we’re never far in our hearts.
And that’s just what I love about us.

The further we get into the relationship, the more we’ll learn about each other. We will probably disagree on some things sometimes as well, but I trust we’ll talk things out and everything will be alright.

I’m ready for it all, the good and the bad with you. Even in just a few weeks I’ve felt a lot more cared for than I ever have before. 
You’re the most perfect man I’ve ever met. I’m so grateful to be yours and I hope I will be for as long as I live. 

Okay, alright, enough about me and a little bit of you, let’s shift the focus to all about YOU birthday boy! 

Literally first meeting you, I saw you as this silly little ray of sunshine in the game. I came here to help people out and maybe be sad a little bit myself, but instead I end up becoming friends with one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. I still laugh about you being the size of an ant on that picnic table 😭

Also… your laugh. Omg
I remember I wanted to try to make you laugh that night just because the first time I heard you laugh it was just so cute and sweet.
But I was really shy, so I kind of did all the laughing that night.

Learning more about you was amazing too. Seeing you knowing all these people on the game and learning that you helped a lot of them out was just so touching to me. You’re such an outstanding person.

Also… how smart you are? Goodness, you can code and work a computer well, you’re an amazing meteorologist, graphic designer, voice actor, writer, and so many other things. You’re just so incredibly talented and you never fail to impress me everyday.

You’re also just so cute, I wish you’d send a snap of you smiling sometime because I seriously love seeing your sweet face. I know you’d look so adorable with a smile. But even if you aren’t comfortable, I still  think you’re such a cutie. ❤️

I could go on forever, but I just want you to know that I’m so in love with you Christian. You’re so precious and perfect and truly saved me when I was going through a lot of pain. I hope to be your wife someday and take care of you, hug, kiss, and cuddle you everyday and just get to love you in person.

Until then, I don’t mind the long distance and promise to never give up on us, ever. The sweetest angel was born today, please make it your day and celebrate yourself. I love you endlessly Christian and I always will. Happy sweet 16 to the sweetest boy with the sweetest heart.

Love, Elizabeth ❤️
