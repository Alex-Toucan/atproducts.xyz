                  <strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this document, the term "Project" will refer to any <a href="https://js.foundation">JS Foundation</a> project using the MIT license <strong>AND</strong> referencing this document in the header of the distributed Project code or Project website source code.

                <h3>Source Code</h3>
                <p>Projects referencing this document are released under the terms of the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license</a>. </p>
                <p>The MIT License is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the Project.</p>

                <h3>Sample Code</h3>
                <p>All demos and examples, whether in a Project's repository or displayed on a Project site, are released under the terms of the license as specified in the relevant repository. Many Projects choose to release their sample code under the terms of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a>. </p>
                <p>CC0 is even more permissive than the MIT license, allowing you to use the code in any manner you want, without any copyright headers, notices, or other attribution.</p>

                <p>The content on a Project web site referencing this document in its header is released under the terms of the license specified in the website's repository or if not specified, under the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license</a>. </p>
