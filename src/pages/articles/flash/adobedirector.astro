          <div id="what">
            <h2> What is Adobe Director </h2>
            <p> Adobe Director is very similar to Adobe Flash Player, but they are both completely different things. Instead of SWF files, it uses DCR files. It can also use Apple Inc.'s Quicktime, used to support media, and the 3DO Company's 3DO Console Engine. Adobe Director's last version was 12, released on February 11th, 2013. The product would be later discontinued in a range from February 1st to March 14th of 2017. </p>
          </div>
          <div id="plugins">
            <h2>Plug-ins</h2> 
            <p> One of the few differences between Director and Flash is that Director supports plug-ins or Xtras. This is possible by a tool named Adobe Director's XDK (Xtra Development Kit), which is a C++ SDK. With each new version, new changes are important for these plug-ins.  </p>
          </div>
          <div id="download">
            <h2> How to use Adobe Director past 2017 </h2>
            <p> Adobe Director has standalone apps that have DCR files pre-loaded (<a href="/media/files/zip/spongebob-example.zip" download>example</a>).</p>
            <p> You can download the most recent version of <a href="/media/files/zip/Projector Skeleton for Adobe Director 12.0.1.122.zip" download>Projector Skeleton for Adobe Director here</a> for using DCR files onto a Windows app. It will ask you once you open the application, to put in a DCR file. Make sure that the plugin is in the same folder (directory) as the DCR file. You can download a <a href="/media/files/swf/anchovies.dcr">example DCR game here</a>.</p>
            <p> If you have issues about 16-bit apps with Director, you may <a href="https://github.com/otya128/winevdm#readme">view how to run them on Windows 10 or above</a>.</p>
