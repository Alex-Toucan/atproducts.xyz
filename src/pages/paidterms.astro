      <h3>I: General Terms</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service govern the use of the paid website Services provided by AT Products LLC ("Company") and the use of Stripe as the <b>primary</b> payment processor. CashApp may be offered as a <b>secondary</b> payment option if needed or requested.<br><br>

        By accessing or using the Company's website creation Services and making payments via Stripe or CashApp, You agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If You do not agree to these terms, please refrain from using our Services.<br><br>

        The Company offers website creation Services ("Services") to clients seeking the development and design of a website. The specific features, functionalities, and deliverables of the Services will be agreed upon in writing between the Company and the client.<br><br>

        <h3>Stripe Payments</h3>
        Stripe is our primary payment processor. By choosing to make a payment via Stripe, You agree to adhere to Stripe’s terms, policies, and security practices. The Company does not collect or store full payment card details; all payment information is processed securely by Stripe. Any disputes, chargebacks, or payment issues related to Stripe transactions are governed by Stripe’s policies.<br><br>
        
        <h3>CashApp Payments</h3>
        CashApp may be used only when Stripe is unavailable or when the client specifically requests it. CashApp is a third‑party payment service, and the Company does not control CashApp’s policies or systems. All payment processing and financial transactions are handled by CashApp. The Company disclaims liability for any issues, errors, or disputes arising from CashApp payments.<br><br>
       
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        Refunds may be offered within 30 days after completion of the Website Design. Refunds may result in deletion of the website or project, as we only provide returns with refunds. Refunds for Stripe transactions follow Stripe’s refund rules. Refunds for CashApp transactions follow CashApp’s refund policies.<br><br>

        Upon the client's full payment for the Services, the Company assigns all intellectual property rights associated with the website created to the client, except for any pre‑existing materials or proprietary tools used by the Company. The client acknowledges that the Company may incorporate third‑party materials (plugins, themes, stock images, etc.). Licensing for such materials is governed by the respective third‑party providers.<br><br>

        The client agrees to maintain the confidentiality of any confidential information received from the Company during the provision of the Services. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, client data, website concepts, and proprietary methodologies.<br><br>

        Until the website design package is completed in full and the invoice is paid, the Company retains ownership of the website. If maintenance services are requested, ownership temporarily returns to the Company until the maintenance work is completed and paid in full. If payment is not made within 30 days after completion of the requested service, the website or project may be deleted permanently. If deletion is not possible, legal action may be taken. The maintenance package does not affect ownership of the site until the design package is completed.<br><br>

        The website provided by the Company is offered "as is" without any warranties, expressed or implied. The Company shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with the Services.<br><br>

        We reserve the right under the Freedom of Association to refuse services to anyone for any reason that does not violate our <a href="/titleiiandvii">Title II & VII Policy</a>. Persistent inquiries regarding refused service(s) may result in a permanent ban and blocking of your email address.<br><br>
      </p>

    <div id="acceptance">
      <h3>II: Acceptance</h3>
      <p>
        Upon contacting us for any service package, You signify Your agreement to this TOS. If You violate any section of the TOS, we reserve the right to revoke Your privileges and ability to use what we provide of Services and Servers.<br><br>
        We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these rules at any time. If a revision has a positive effect on You, we will make efforts to provide at least a 30‑day notice before new rules take effect. A sufficient revision is determined at our sole discretion.
